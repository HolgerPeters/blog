title: Beyond UML: Diagrams for Hackers
---

When writing software, there is a zoo of programming languages available at our fingertip.
But if you want to visualize things in software engineering using diagrams, there is just one omnipresent graphical language for this: UML.
Omnipresent at least in the world of "enterprise" software, yet, there is another world of software engineering, that seems blissfully unaware or actively rejecting UML as a useful tool.

Personally, I like diagrams in software engineering for communication with teammates, and also for clarifying my own thought in the engineering process.
Unfortunately, UML often does not deliver for both of these goals.
UML is unsuitable for communication with someone who is not a heavy UML user themself, it requires training to read an UML diagram.
For guiding the engineering process, I find that it lures people into making detailed specifications way to soon, when it would be much better to discuss high-level assumptions and various implementation ideas.

Fortunately, UML is not the only visual language useful in software engineering, and I would like to present a few diagram types that either I found useful, or that seem to be popular among open source projects.

## Block Diagrams

## Entity Relationship Diagrams

## Event Storming
