I am delighted to be invited at [Budapest BI Forum
2015](http://budapestbiforum.hu/) on October 14th, 2015. My
[talk](https://budapestbi2015.sched.org/event/a4dfe3dbd53ca8b92a21ca2f80d214f6)
will be about writing composable, testable and robust machine learning
pipelines. The [schedule](https://budapestbi2015.sched.org/) is full of
interesting talks, and I am sure I will enjoy it a lot!
