I usually use [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) to manage my Python
interpreters and obtain them in whatever version I need. Another tool I
occasionally use is [tox](tox.readthedocs.io) by Holger Krekel, which
nicely generates build matrices for library and python interpreter
versions, that come handy when you develop a library targeting multiple
Python versions (and dependencies).

However, until recently I didn't know how to use the two of them
together. With `pyenv`, I usually ended up with one python interpreter
in my path, so tox had only one interpreter to choose from, and I was
missing out on tox' selling point: testing your code over various
versions of Python.

# Install Multiple Python Version With Pyenv

Setting up your pyenv usually looks like this:

    % pyenv install 3.5.1
    % pyenv install 2.7.10
    % cd my_project_dir
    % pyenv local 3.5.1

Now it is possible to use multiple Python versions here:

    % pyenv local 3.5.1 2.7.10
    % python3.5 --version
    Python 3.5.1
    % python2.7 --version
    Python 2.7.10

Then, tox can find interpreters, typically you will have a `tox.ini` in
your project that starts with something like this:

{% highlight ini  %}
[tox]
envlist = py27,py34,py35
skip_missing_interpreters = True

[testenv]
commands=py.test
deps = -rrequirements.txt
{% endhighlight %}

Invoking `tox` should now run tox with the two available Python
versions, 2.7 and 3.5, skipping 3.4 unless it is installed.
