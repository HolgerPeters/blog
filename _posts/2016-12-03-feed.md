title: Fixing Python-only feeds
---

I moved this blog to a new blog software and had lost the
ability to build custom feeds on tags. This should at least
work now for the Python tag again and so your feed readers
should be able to load [Python feed](http://www.holger-peters.de/feeds/python.atom.xml)
again. Let me know if this is not working.

The IDs of posts in that feed are probably not the same as
in the static site generator I used before, so your feed
reader might show some old posts as unread, although you
have read them already.
