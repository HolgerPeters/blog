title: Optimizing for secondary virtues
---

When your environment claims or strives to be agile, you
will probably stumble over an interesting pattern:
Many people people who identifiy with the agile approach,
will also give you simple, straightforward advice (or
rule-like guidelines) on how you can be agile. Such advice
typically revolves around things like sprint-lengths (god
forbid if they are longer than two weeks), the stand-up
meeting (everyone should be there, and it should be < 15
minutes), or the a kanban/task board (each day you should
see some movement there).

What you typically do not hear (at least so infrequent that
it isn't worth mentioning) are quotes from the agile
manifesto like

> Deliver working software frequently, from a
> couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
> preference to the shorter timescale.

or the Scrum Guide, that can tell us about sprint lenghts

> The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or
> less during which a "Done", useable, and potentially
> releasable product Increment is created.


Yet when teams struggle with two-week sprints, you still
hear agile evangelists insisting on two-week sprints,
instead of suggesting the team to deliver work in frequent
increments and test what time-scale is suitable in their
current situation and go on from there.

Similarly, for the daily standup meeting, the _Daily Scrum_,
the the scrum guide is very clear that this is a meeting
where the development team (which does not include the PO or
the SM) plan their work.

> The Daily Scrum is an internal meeting for the Development
> Team. If others are present, the Scrum Master ensures that
> they do not disrupt the meeting.


Yet, many agile enthusiasts will insist onhaving a reporting
meeting with individuals reporting in 1-2 minute time boxes.


## Second hand virtues

We observe these behaviours, because it is easy to focus on
_secondary virtues_ which are easy to remember, than on
_primary virtues_, which are harder to remember or to
achieve. Pointing out that the team did not deliver within a
two-week time window is easy, finding the right fit between
sprint duration and work-complexity is hard. Focussing daily
on conducting a meeting for the benefit of the development
team is hard, conducting a daily reporting meeting with a 15
minute time box is easy.

The huge problem with focussing on _seconday virtues_ is,
that the _primary virtues_ are forgotten, and then, the
_secondary virtues_ lose their benefit, because they start
to disorient, instead of support people in their pursuit of
the _primary virtues_.

## How to break the cycle

My hypothesis is, that a lot of secondary virtues are just
simpler to remember and apply. More important but more
complicated guidelines are forgotten or deprioritized in
favour fo the easy-to-remember rules.

This is why we see Scrum Masters fighting 4-week-sprints
with tooth and nail, while they remain fairly silent on
sprints and stories without value delivery.

This is also why we see teams conducting Daily Scrum
meetings that do not help the development team delivering
value, but we see a reporting meeting with tight
time-keeping.

## What can we do about it?

The first step is to rediscover the intent of the
recommendation, reading the primary and early sources.
Then, you can start looking for obvious contradictions
between the way you work and (a) the primary sources and (b)
your model of well-organized and successful  work.  These
are the starting point for meaningful change and
experimentation. Is it helpful to conduct longer sprints?
Are sprints themselves helpful to delivering value
frequently? How would the developers prefer to communicate
and organize their work? How can the standup become their
meeting?

If you are working in an agile team, you must be given the
leg room to explore, inspect and adapt - just as the
signatories of the agile manifesto did.
