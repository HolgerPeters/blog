I am delighted to be invited at `Budapest BI Forum 2015
<http://budapestbiforum.hu/>`_ on October 14th, 2015. My `talk
<https://budapestbi2015.sched.org/event/a4dfe3dbd53ca8b92a21ca2f80d214f6>`_
will be about writing composable, testable and robust machine learning
pipelines. The `schedule <https://budapestbi2015.sched.org/>`_ is full of interesting talks, and I am sure I will enjoy it a lot!
