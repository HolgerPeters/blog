Some common advice among developers is to learn "a
programming language a year". I will not argue for or
against this advice. Nevertheless, you might also consider
to learn something different: For once, you might start
learning another foreign language.

The same way that another programming language can broaden
your mind and let experience new ways of programming, a
foreign language can broaden your experiences, let you
understand other cultures and countries better, and give you
a better understanding of your native language. So, do some
research on what language you could learn, buy a book,
attend a language class, listen to radio or whatch one of
those movies you almost know by heart in the language you
are learning. Listen to music and immerse yourself for half
an hour a day. Chances are, that you will have something
along the way.

Why do I bring this up? `John D. Cook blogged about whether
fluent language speakers exist or not
<http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2015/10/07/second-languages-and-selection-bias>`_
(he concludes that selection bias is involved). I would like
to add: if we can learn math, and multiple programming
languages, why not learn French, Turkish, Japanese or
Swahili?
