I am a Data Scientist. With the diverse definitions and
interpretations of that term, it might need some more
explanation here.

I see my role as that of a Software Engineer: Solving
problems by providing reliable software. The class of
problems I like to tackle involve data. By this definition a
data scientist is a person, who incorporates properties of a
software engineer and an applied statistician, whose
analyses are put to the test every day.
